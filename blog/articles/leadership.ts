# From Coder to Tech Lead

## The Transition
Moving from an individual contributor (IC) to a Tech Lead is one of the hardest transitions in engineering. You are no longer solely responsible for your code; you are responsible for the team's output.

## Key Responsibilities
1. **Architecture**: Making high-level decisions that scale.
2. **Mentorship**: Helping juniors grow.
3. **Shielding**: Protecting the team from external chaos.

## The Art of Delegation
Delegation is not about dumping work; it's about empowering others to own a problem.

## Conducting Code Reviews
Code reviews are for sharing knowledge, not just finding bugs.

> "Great leaders don't set out to be a leader... they set out to make a difference. It's never about the role-always about the goal."

## Conclusion
Leadership is a service. Your job is to unblock your team and help them do their best work.
